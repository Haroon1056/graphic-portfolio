## ðŸŽ¨ My Design Philosophy

<div class="grid fade-in">
<div class="service-card slide-up">
<h3>Strategy First </h3>
<P>Design without purpose is just decoration.  
I start every project by understanding your business, your audience, and your goals â€” so we create visuals that perform.</P>
</div>

<div class="service-card slide-up delay-1">
<h3>Craft Matters </h3>
<p>In a digital world full of noise, I believe in quality.  
Whether it's aligned typography or sharp mockups, the details matter and help your brand stand out.</p>
</div>


<div class="service-card slide-up delay-2">
<h3>Systems Thinking </h3>
<p>A good design works everywhere â€” social media, packaging, websites.  
I create brand systems that are consistent, flexible, and scalable as you grow.</p>
