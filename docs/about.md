## My Design Philosophy

::: grid
```markdown
### Strategy First

Design without strategy is decoration. Every project begins with research - understanding your market, audience and business objectives to create work that performs.

### Craft Matters

In a digital world, I champion thoughtful execution. Whether it's perfect kerning or precise packaging dielines, the details make the difference.

### Systems Thinking

Great identities work across all touchpoints. I design flexible systems that maintain consistency while allowing room to grow.
